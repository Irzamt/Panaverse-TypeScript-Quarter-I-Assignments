- User should login by entering his/her unique account number and a secret PIN
- User can check account balance 
- User can withdraw money 
- User can check his/her previous transections in the current login
- User should be asked at the end of each function that if he/she wants to end transections or perform any other transections if the user choose more transections he/she must be shown all the options again and he / she can perform any transections.
